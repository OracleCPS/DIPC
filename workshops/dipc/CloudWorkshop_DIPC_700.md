# Lab 700 - Under the covers DIPCS (Notes only)

## Notes by Rick Michaud on 5/29/2018

### Lab Notes

- Intent of this lab is to show the various engines within DIPC that do various types of processing like ODI for batch ELT processing and GoldenGate for streaming replication processing.
- This helps to communicate value of DIPCS by showing the power of the underpinnings.
- This "feature" will not be included in ADIPCS per PM.   Perhaps specific labs can be added for ADIPCS to this workshop once its released.
- Labs can use/repurpose content from existing on-premise workshop (DIS Master V4).
