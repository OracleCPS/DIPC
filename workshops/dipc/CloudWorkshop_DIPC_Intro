### Introduction
Oracle Data Integration Platform Cloud is a platform that unifies various Data Integration components and leverages their core strengths and functionality to offer a seamless set of data integration services in the cloud.

When using the Oracle Data Integration Platform Cloud, you create a Data Integration environment in the cloud. After you complete the instance creation wizard, your environment is provisioned and fully integrated for replication, extract, load and transform, streaming, data preparation, and data governance.

For Data Integration Platform Cloud, you can select one of the following editions:

- Standard Edition: For a bulk copy of your data sources to the cloud, or to extract, load and transform your data.
- Enterprise Edition: For a selective copy or real time replication of your data sources, or to extract, load and transform your data.
